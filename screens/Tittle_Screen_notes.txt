Notes from KINGDOM3.INC

----Keywords/User-defined functions definitions ---- (All user-defined functions are declared in Kingdom1.INC)

0) unit: refers to a separate code module that can be included in a larger program... 
essentially acting like a library. 
To import/inlcude these in a program then the keyword 'uses' needs to be used followed my 'unit' name/s

1) procedure: Unlike a "function" in Pascal, a procedure does not return a value when called. 

2) var: Signifies the beginning of a section where you declare variables.

3) label: A label is a named identifier that is used with the "goto"...
statement to jump to a specific line of code within a program block.

4) 'begin' and 'end': Where a sequence of statements within a procedure or function should be executed;...
it is always paired with the "end" keyword.

5) ClearKeys(User-define Function): Clears any prior input from the keyboard/mouse.

6) gotoxy: positions the cursor at (X,Y) direction relative to the origin of the current window. 

7) flash(User-define Function): In short, this procedure makes a message flash on the screen at a given position, changing its color rapidly, until the user presses a key.

8) col(User-define Function): This procedure changes the text color based on the state of the Color variable...

9) write: Display text to the screen with no new line.

10) writeln: Display text to the screen with new line.

11) clrscr: Clears the screen to a blank canvas afte a certain event.

12) Cur(User-define Function): Cursor style is chosen based on the value of the Num parameter (1, 2, or 3) and the Color variable

13) repeat and untilL: Essentially a 'do{} while()' loop. This is what makes the big "KROZ" word change colors

************ Side notes: How functions are created in Pascal ************
- To create a function in Pascal, use the syntax: function FunctionName(Parameter1: Type1; Parameter2: Type2; ...): ReturnType; followed by a begin block containing the function logic, and ending with end;
ReturnType; followed by a begin block containing the function logic, and ending with end;

- Turbo pascal is NOT case-sensitive...
for example; procedures are defined with first letter as uppercased then they are called with all lower case.

- Col function in Pascal only takes values 0-15, those were the only available colors at the time

INPUTS:
- When incorrect mouse/keyboard inputs are giving the game will produce a disturbing sound
